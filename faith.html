      <h3><em><strong>AN EXPERIENCE WITH MY GREAT GRANDMA THAT CHANGED MY HEART</strong></em></h3>
      <p><em><strong id="blogbox"> While staying with my parents for a while I offered to help with a variety of tasks needed to get done daily. Normally I would make dinner, clean the house, wash dishes and a host of other chores. My great grandma, who is 103-years-old, was being taken care of by my great aunt and other family members. However, on some days, my mom would step in to help bathe her in the mornings when certain people could not. I offered to come with her a couple times and it was a very eye-opening experience. 
        
        My great grandma, who took care of me when I was a baby up until I was in my teens, could not take care of herself anymore. I literally had to help get her out of bed, move her legs and arms. At one point she looked at me and said, “Brittany, I didn’t know you were into this kind of work.” We all laughed because in reality…I wasn’t. I never thought I would be helping my great grandma this way. It’s funny how you find yourself in interesting circumstances as you get older. Bathing her and getting her dressed was such a task! I was glad to be in shape cause lifting her was not easy. I would have to hold her up while my mom helped her get dressed. At that point, her head was resting on my chest. My how the tables have turned! The woman who held me in her arms was now relying on me to help hold her. It was a moment I would never forget. After leaving that day I gained a new found respect for my mom and my great aunt. I also gained even more respect for those who work to take of senior citizens in retirement facilities. I realized that senior citizens were a gift from God, just like babies. The first day I went down to my grandma’s I felt kind of weird because I felt like I shouldn’t be there. But, now, I’m happy to have had the opportunity to take care of her the same way she took care of me. 
        
        So, here’s the point of this blog post. If someone is growing old in your family and needs help…take care of them. You’ll see how much of a difference that makes on the individual as well as yourself. </strong></em></p>
