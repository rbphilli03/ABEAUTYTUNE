      <h3 class="BlogHeaders"><em><strong>A Story in Genesis That Made Me Look Twice in the Mirror</strong></em></h3>
      </div> 
      <img src="images/spring_water.jpg" alt="" width="721" height="400" class="bannerImage"/>
      </div>
      
      
      <div><p>It was a story that I’ve read a couple of times before…how Abraham’s son Isaac met his wife Rebekah. But this time was a little different. </p> 
        
        <p>The story talked about how Abraham told his servant to travel back to his homeland to find a wife for his son, Isaac. When the servant arrived, he prayed and asked God for guidance and assurance in picking the right woman for Isaac. </p> 
        
        <p>Before he had finished praying, Rebekah came out near where the servant was to get water from a well.</p>
        
        <p>When I read that part I thought, “Wow! While in the midst of his praying, the answer he needed was coming towards him!”  Hebrews 13:8 says, “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever,” which means if it happened then…it can happen today! All we need to do is believe.</p>
        
        <p>As I continued to read, the story talked about how Rebekah gave the servant a drink and also his camels a drink. It showed Rebekah’s attitude of service, a characteristic that the servant was also looking for. When I read that part I realized that was something that I lacked…service and how I needed work on showing that act more often.</p>
        
        <p>Just from that one story I realized two things: How God answers prayer right in the middle of you asking it and how meaningful it is to show acts of service.  At times when I would pray, sometimes I would still have doubt. Or, I would wonder how long it would take for God to answer me? But God can change a situation in a matter of 60 seconds. Just believe in him.</p>
        
        <p>That’s now my daily goal. Believing that God can and will do the impossible at any time, at any moment…. so be ready.</p>
        
        <p>Note: The story about Rebekah began in Genesis, chapter 24.</p>

      </div> 
      <img src="images/Elderly_hands.jpg" alt="" width="721" height="400" class="bannerImage"/>
      </div>
      
      
      <div><p> While staying with my parents for a while I offered to help with a variety of tasks needed to get done daily. Normally I would make dinner, clean the house, wash dishes and a host of other chores. My great grandma, who is 103-years-old, was being taken care of by my great aunt and other family members. However, on some days, my mom would step in to help bathe her in the mornings when certain people could not. I offered to come with her a couple times and it was a very eye-opening experience.</p> 
        
        <p>My great grandma, who took care of me when I was a baby up until I was in my teens, could not take care of herself anymore. I literally had to help get her out of bed, move her legs and arms. At one point she looked at me and said, “Brittany, I didn’t know you were into this kind of work.” We all laughed because in reality…I wasn’t. I never thought I would be helping my great grandma this way. It’s funny how you find yourself in interesting circumstances as you get older. Bathing her and getting her dressed was such a task! I was glad to be in shape cause lifting her was not easy. I would have to hold her up while my mom helped her get dressed. At that point, her head was resting on my chest. My how the tables have turned! The woman who held me in her arms was now relying on me to help hold her. It was a moment I would never forget. After leaving that day I gained a new found respect for my mom and my great aunt. I also gained even more respect for those who work to take of senior citizens in retirement facilities. I realized that senior citizens were a gift from God, just like babies. The first day I went down to my grandma’s I felt kind of weird because I felt like I shouldn’t be there. But, now, I’m happy to have had the opportunity to take care of her the same way she took care of me.</p> 
        
        <p>So, here’s the point of this blog post. If someone is growing old in your family and needs help…take care of them. You’ll see how much of a difference that makes on the individual as well as yourself. </p>
